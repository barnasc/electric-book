# Adoption and joint development overview

## Style for IEEE documents to be adopted by another organization

An IEEE standard shall conform to the IEEE SA Standards Style Manual, even if it is expected that the standard will also be submitted to another recognized SDO for adoption. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of American English spelling and the use of a period as a decimal sign. For guidance on style issues not explicitly addressed in this manual, please consult *The Chicago Manual of Style* or consult the IEEE SA content publishing staff. Deviations from the style set forth in this manual shall be approved by IEEE SA publishing management.

## IEEE documents developed jointly with other organizations

IEEE standards may be developed jointly with other organizations with the appropriate agreements in place.

An IEEE SA Program Manager shall be notified at the beginning of the standards development process if there is an intention to jointly develop a standard with another organization.
